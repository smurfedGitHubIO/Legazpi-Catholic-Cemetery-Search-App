# Legazpi-Catholic-Cemetery-Search-App v2.0

Simple search app that searches data based on given input.

> Note: It only lists the top 10 closest searches on the list.

### Installation

1. Make sure to install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) before downloading the source codes.
2. Download the source codes (ZIP file) and extract them in a folder.
3. Open two terminals and open the directory for `server` folder on one terminal and the `client` folder on the other.
4. Run `npm install` on both terminals. You can close the `client` terminal after installation.
5. On the `server` terminal, run `npm run dev`. The page should pop up by now at `localhost:3000`.

Whenever you would run the application, just open up the terminal and path towards the `server` directory. Then run `npm run dev`. For more info, kindly contact (+63906-065-2947).
